# Critical Path Method (CPM) Example

The **Critical Path Method (CPM)** is a project scheduling technique used to determine the sequence of activities that directly affects the total project duration.  
By identifying the *critical path*‚Äîthe longest sequence of dependent tasks‚Äîyou can see which activities have **zero slack** and must be completed on time to avoid delaying the project.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv add pycritical pandas openpyxl
```

Run from the project root:

```bash
uv run ./section-7/critical-path-method/main.py
```

The script will:
1. Load tasks from `cpm_tasks.xlsx` (sheet: `example`).
2. Run CPM with **pyCritical**.
3. Print the CPM results.
4. Display a Gantt chart.
